# Data Structures Implementations in Java

Welcome to the **Data Structures Implementation** repository!  
This project contains clean, well-commented Java implementations of core data structures that are essential for mastering algorithms and cracking technical interviews.

## StackDS?

- Stack using Object Arrays
- Stack using Generics (`<E>`)
- Custom `StackEmptyException`
- Operations `push,pop,isEmpty,peek,size,increaseCapacity`
- `toString()` method to print stack content
- `Iterator` support for enhanced `for-each` loops
- Sample `main()` class to test the stack
- Example `stack` problem
